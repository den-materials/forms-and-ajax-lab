# Build Your Own Search Engine

For this lab, your task is to create a search page for a web API of your choosing. Think [Cat Rescue](https://github.com/den-wdi-2/js-ajax-lab) on steroids. Choose an API that you would be really excited to play with, and make your page as user-friendly as possible. There is no starter code for this lab, so the most important piece will be breaking it down into small, testable parts. You may also want to mock up your page design and whiteboard your approach to problems.

## Requirements:

Your app must:

1. Use a 3rd party API.
  - For ideas, you can go to the [Public API Directory](http://public.apis.zone/). Consider filtering by Auth = no.
2. Use forms to input queries to be sent to the 3rd party API.
  - You should have at least three input fields, with at least two different input types.
3. Use `preventDefault()`.
4. Dynamically update the query string of the request based on user input.
5. Render results on the screen.

## Bonus:

Once you meet the above requirements, bring your app to life with some professional, sleek design. For ideas, you may want to revisit the [Mad Lib Form Lab](https://github.com/den-materials/css-html-forms-lab).
